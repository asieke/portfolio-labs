	"The Prodigal Son" is a parable told by Jesus in the New Testament, found in the Gospel of Luke
	(15:11â€“32). The story revolves around a father and his two sons, demonstrating the themes of
	repentance, forgiveness, and the enduring love of God. The younger son, discontent with his life
	at home, requests his share of the inheritance from his father, who surprisingly acquiesces. With
	his newfound wealth, the young man departs for a distant country, away from the confines of his
	familial responsibilities. He indulges in a life of extravagance and debauchery, quickly
	squandering his entire inheritance on reckless living. Once the money runs out, a severe famine
	strikes the land, leaving the young man destitute. His situation worsens to the point that he
	resorts to working as a pig herder, a job deemed unclean in Jewish tradition. Desperate and
	hungry, he even contemplates eating the pigs' feed. Amidst his desolation, he experiences a moment
	of clarity and regret, resolving to return home, apologize to his father, and ask to be treated as
	a hired servant. Meanwhile, the older son continues to dutifully serve his father, obedient and
	responsible. However, he harbors resentment and jealousy, feelings that are revealed later in the
	story. Upon the younger son's return, his father, who had been waiting anxiously, spots him from a
	distance. Overflowing with joy, the father runs to his returning son, embracing him before he can
	finish his rehearsed apology. The father promptly orders his servants to bring the best robe, a
	ring for his son's hand, and sandals for his feet. He also orders a fattened calf to be killed for
	a feast to celebrate his son's return. When the elder son returns from the fields and learns of
	the celebration, he's filled with resentment and refuses to join. He confronts his father, stating
	he'd been loyal all these years yet never received such a feast. The father, compassionate and
	understanding, explains that the older son was always with him, and everything he has is his.
	However, the return of the younger son is a time for celebration because he was "dead" and is now
	"alive again", was "lost" and is now "found". This parable illustrates the contrast between the
	forgiving nature of the father (symbolizing God's infinite mercy) and the attitude of the older
	son (representing the Pharisees' self-righteousness and lack of compassion). The prodigal son's
	journey of sin, repentance, and forgiveness is seen as a metaphor for the transformative power of
	God's love and forgiveness.
